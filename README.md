# American Red Cross Branch Location Scraper

The American Red Cross has a vast real estate footprint across the country. As these locations can change over time, it can be difficult to maintain up-to-date list of these locations and their contact information. 

This scraping tool leverages the BeautifulSoup Python library to loop over a list of pages on the [American Red Cross](www.redcross.org) webpage that records each location per region and saves the output to a local CSV.
